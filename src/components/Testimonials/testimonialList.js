    testimonial:`Carl submitted code that showed clear logical thinking and attention to craft.
                When creativity was allowed, Carl showed ingenuity and a sense of humor. Reading his
                code was a joy (and reading computer code rarely is! ) because it showed an extremely intelligent
                and playful mind at work.`,

    testimonial:`Mr. Solli showed extraordinary capabilities at being able to absorb the concepts being presented and to
                incorporate them into the coding skills we were covering. He very quickly established himself as one of the top performers
                in the incoming freshman class. The material and programs that he turned in for the Lab and Homework assignments went well
                beyond what was required and indicated the he was pursuing additional self-motivated study outside of the class room.
